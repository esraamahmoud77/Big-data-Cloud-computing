# Social Media Analytics with Apache Spark
## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Apache Spark and relevant big data tools for Social Media Analytics. The goal is to gain insights into user behavior, trends, and sentiment by analyzing data collected from various social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
## Problem Specification
1. Data Collection
* Overview: In this initial phase, the focus is on collecting data from diverse sources. Utilize APIs provided by different social media platforms or third-party tools for downloading historical data.
Implementation: The collected data should be stored in a Spark-aware data format, such as JSON or CSV.
* Report: Elaborate on the data collection process, specifying the sources used and describing the collected data.
2. Data Preparation
* Overview: Prepare the collected data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and extracting relevant features like user names, post text, hashtags, and URLs.
Implementation: Utilize Spark's built-in data processing functions, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregation, to clean and prepare the data.
* Report: Detail the data preparation steps taken, including the type of cleaning performed and the features extracted.
3. Data Analysis
* Overview: Utilize Spark's machine learning libraries, such as MLlib, for data analysis. Perform tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling to gain insights.
Implementation: Use supervised learning for sentiment analysis, classifying posts as positive, negative, or neutral. For topic modeling, employ unsupervised learning to identify common themes in social media posts.
* Report: Elaborate on the data analysis process, specifying the techniques applied and insights gained.
4. Data Visualization
* Overview: Utilize Spark's data visualization libraries, like SparkSQL, to present the results of the analysis.
Implementation: Create visualizations, such as graphs, charts, and maps, to depict the distribution of sentiment, topic, or network characteristics.
* Report: Describe the type of visualizations created and how they contribute to understanding user behavior, trends, and sentiment.
